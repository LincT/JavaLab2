/**
 *
 * A parcel delivery company charges the following rates to ship a parcel.

 •	Up to 10 pounds: $2.15 per pound
 •	Up to 20 pounds: $1.55 per pound
 •	Up to 30 pounds: $1.15 per pound

 The shipping company does not ship parcels that weigh over 30 pounds.

 So, a parcel that weighs 17 pounds will cost $1.55 x 17 = $26.35.

 Write a program that asks the user for the weight of a parcel and displays whether it can be shipped, and what it will cost.

 Optional extra: the most obvious solution to this problem uses if statements for the price bands. Can you think of a different way?  Hint – loops and arrays of price and max weights for price?
